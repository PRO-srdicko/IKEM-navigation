You can create a map of points with types of corridor, door or elevator. You can create lines between points to indicate that you can walk between these points. You can set descriptions for both lines and points. The length of the line is then computed automatically In the processing module. You can change the floor plans to add points on other floors. To connect between floors you have to place elevators and set the same elevator group for each elevator point on different floors. You can turn on and off the snapping to an invisible grid for nicer configurations. Zoom in and out, move the plane and drag placed points.
